Welcome to the Random Question Generator repository! This project is a simple web application that generates random questions for various purposes such as icebreakers, conversation starters, or brainstorming activities.

## Usage

To use the Random Question Generator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "Generate Question" button to generate a random question.
3. Each time you click the button, a new question will appear.

Feel free to use the generated questions for any activity or discussion that requires random prompts.

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The provided `index.html` file contains the structure and elements of the application's user interface. The corresponding styles are defined in the `style.css` file.

The random question generation functionality is implemented in the `script.js` file using JavaScript.

## Customizing Questions

If you would like to customize the list of questions or add your own, you can modify the `script.js` file. Look for the `questions` array and add or remove questions as needed. Each question is represented as a string within the array.

```javascript
const questions = [
  "What is your favorite book?",
  "If you could have any superpower, what would it be?",
  "What is your dream travel destination?",
  // Add more questions here
];
```
